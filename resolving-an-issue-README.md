This was just a quick commit to see if I could commit some code where it wouldn't upload. 
The issue was, when i created a branch locally and worked there, 
then uploaded my code after creating a repo there was nothing, no uploaded code and my local git was unresponcive. 
That was this perpose of this repo, just testing the repo.
